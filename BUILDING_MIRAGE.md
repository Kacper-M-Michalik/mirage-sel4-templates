# Building MirageOS for sel4
MirageOS can be run inside sel4 as a Virtual Machine. Microkit is used to create VMM's that control MirageOS guests, and solo5 is used as a shim by MirageOS to perform environment setup before running OCaml based code.
<br><br>
Currently Microkit and the solo5 VMM library only support virtualisation of aarch64 guests, as such your solo5 based unikernels must be built for aarch64 with the hvt target.

For all build methods, the final executable should be in the ```./dist``` folder.

## Building on aarch64
Building on aarch64 follows the standard steps, with hvt as the target:

```sh
mirage configure -t hvt
make depends
make build
```

## Building on x86_64 for aarch64:
Cross-compiling on x86_64 requires a few extra steps, running them in this order is important; any other commands that would cause reinstallation of the dependencies will drop the cross-compiler: 

```sh
mirage configure -t hvt
make depends
# These steps specifically allow cross compiling
opam install ocaml-solo5-cross-aarch64
dune clean
make build
```

If you have problems, try building for x86_64 first, then following the above steps again.
